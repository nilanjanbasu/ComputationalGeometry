This is the implementation of hidden surface removal algorithm with binary space partitioning tree. This implementation is done in 1 Dimension.
You can find an executable JAR here to run it in your local system.
Also, link to an youtube video of demo of the software:

Explanation of the software:

The line in right window represents the axis along which eye can look in either direction. Add random slab option adds a wall in the line. Now, the left window represents how the several walls will be visible in a particular direction. A taller and wider wall behind a smaller wall will be partially visible whereas the opposite is not true. This is the hidden surface removal effect. One can reverse the direction of the eye by pressing a button.
